# Movie Data Analysis

## Description 
The Movie Dataset was the primary focus of this comprehensive data analysis study, which is presented in this paper. The main goal is to disentangle the complex relationship that exists between two important elements—votes and budget—and a film's overall success. This research looks at these important data in an attempt to identify trends that provide insight into the factors affecting a film's box office success and critical reception.
